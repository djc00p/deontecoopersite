      I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API, which exposes the SalesEngine data schema. I also learned how to to build Single-Responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned API, how to use controller tests to drive my design, and used Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more complicated business intelligence.
