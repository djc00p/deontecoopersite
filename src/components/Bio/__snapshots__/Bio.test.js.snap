      Some hobbies of mine are Video Games and Music Production. I have been playing video games since as far back as I can remember and that is what sparked my interest in programming. I mostly play RPGs (Role-Playing Games) like The Witcher 3, Mass Effect, Pokemon, Dark Souls and many more. I also enjoy FPS (First-Person Shooters) games like Call of Duty and Battlefield. I enjoy a well-told story and a good challenge. Dark Souls is the gaming version of how I describe programming. It is challenging but not impossible, with a little grit and understanding of how things work you can overcome any challenge. Music is my favorite creation by humankind. It is one of the few things that can bring people of different backgrounds together and have an impact on each individual. It can envelop emotions that can speak the truths of the heart without one even knowing and there is always a song for someone out there. Music is my life and passion and I want to share that passion with the world.

       so that I can grow fruits and vegetables in my home without the use of soil. In hopes of using what I've learned, I would like to help my family and friends start growing at home as well. I would like to start an mini side business with my excess produce and sell it at farmers marts. I would also like to share what I've learned with others to show that anyone can do it as well.
